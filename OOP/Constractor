// Important about constractor

//A constructor is a special type of member function that is called automatically when an object is created.
//In C++, a constructor has the same name as that of the class and it does not have a return type.
/*
Constructor should:
Have the same name of the class.
Should not return type.
Should be Public.
*/

//Default Constructor: A constructor with no parameters is known as a default constructor.
/*
You should always write Default Constructor.
No, because if you don't write it the compiler will write it for you.
*/

//Parameterized Constructor: a constructor with parameters is known as a parameterized constructor. This is the preferred method to initialize member data.

//When you have a parameterized constructor it will override the default constructor.
//A constructor is primarily used to initialize objects. They are also used to run a default code when an object is created.
